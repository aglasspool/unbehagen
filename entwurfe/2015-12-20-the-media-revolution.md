> _"Whatever we do, we are supposed to do for the sake of “making a living”; such is the verdict of society, and the number of people, especially in the professions who might challenge it, has decreased rapidly. The only exception society is willing to grant is the artist, who, strictly speaking, is the only “worker” left in a laboring society."_[^1]



How rapidly Arendt’s vision of the artist as an exception in a society of labourers has dwindled, its bearings lost as art takes its place in the new economy of _‘creativity, spontaneity, authenticity, self-expression and a cult of personality.’_[^2]

> "Let it [the practice of analysis] be renounced then, by whoever cannot rejoin at its horizon
the subjectivity of his time. For how could he possibly make his being the axis of so many
lives if he knew nothing of the dialectic that engages him with these lives in a symbolic move-
ment? Let him be well acquainted with the whorl into which his period draws him in the con-
tinued enterprise of Babel, and let him be aware of his function as interpreter in the discord of
languages.”[^3]

Freud, the artist is always one step ahead of the psychoanalyst.

> _"For most of Stein's contemporaries, language purported to be transparent, a medium by which we see through to ideas and the world. For Stein, language and its accomplice, print, were only another means of perpetuating the seamless totality, of covering difference."_

## VD

The stupid idea that an image shows the world - when it only obfuscates what it fixates.  
The stupid idea that an image documents the world - when it only encumbers.  
The stupid idea that an image makes people think - when it only distracts.  

->"it could indicate the designation without designation." (i.e. it could point out/denounce the sign/value judgement without itself being a sign/value judegment.)   
 ->"find ways to manifest the immanence of this impossibility of language."

## Conclusion
The discours of science has convinced most of us that there is knowledge in the real - i.e. that there are signs rather than signifiers; that the art object, indeed all objects are windows onto the world. What VP attempts to convey is that these are mirrors rather than windows - reflective rather than reflexive. Highlighting the materiality of the signifier and the fact that all discourses fail. 

Objectialisation (being an object for or reifying an object in the Other) is an operation on enjoyment (S1->S2). Only a subversion of the subject's relation to his/her enjoyment can open the possibility of a real transformation a -> $, S1//S2. VD  
La jouissance feminine au lieu de la jouissance phallique (JAM - L'un Tout Seul).  

One sees oneself seeing (the $ubject is detached/divided from S1 and sees itS1elf seeing [S1->S2]).  

Basically, some kind of detachment of $ubjective destitution is necessary otherwise one is caught up in a discourse (S1->S2). All discourses are internal to capitalism because they create surplus value.  

> The escabeaus are there to produce beauty, because beauty is the last defence against the real. But once the escabeaus have been overturned and burned, it still falls to the analysed parlêtre to demonstrate his savoir-faire with the real, to demonstrate how he knew how to make an art object, and how he knew how to say it, to say it well.
